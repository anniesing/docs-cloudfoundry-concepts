## <a id='introduction'></a>Introduction ##

This topic provides an overview of Application Security Groups (ASGs), and describes how to manage and administer them. Many of the steps below require the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool. 

###<a id="defn"></a>Application Security Groups

Application Security Groups (ASGs) are a collections of egress rules that
specify the protocols, ports, and IP address ranges where app or task instances 
send traffic.
Because ASGs define **allow** rules, their order of evaluation is unimportant
when multiple ASGs apply to the same space or deployment.
The platform sets up rules to filter and log outbound network traffic from app and task instances.
ASGs apply to both buildpack-based and Docker-based apps and tasks.

When apps or tasks begin staging, they need traffic rules permissive enough to
allow them to pull resources from the network.
After an app or task is running, the traffic rules can be more restrictive and
secure.
To distinguish between these two security requirements, administrators can
define one ASG for app and task staging, and another for app and task runtime.

To provide granular control when securing a deployment, an administrator can
assign ASGs to apply to all app and task instances for the entire deployment,
or assign ASGs to spaces to apply only to apps and tasks in a particular space.

ASGs can be complicated to configure correctly, especially when the specific IP
addresses listed in a group change.
To simplify securing a deployment while still permitting apps reach external
services, operators can deploy the services into a subnet that is separate from
their Cloud Foundry deployment.
Then the operators can create ASGs for the apps that whitelist those service
subnets, while denying access to any virtual machine (VM) hosting other apps.

For examples of typical ASGs, see the <a href="#typical-groups">Typical Application Security Groups</a> section of this topic.

### <a id="asg-sets"></a> ASG Sets

ASGs are applied by configuring ASG sets differentiated by _scope_, platform-wide or space specific, and _lifecycle_, staging or running.

Currently, four ASG sets exist in Cloud Foundry:

+ Platform-wide staging ASG set, also called "default-staging"
+ Platform-wide running ASG set, also called "default-running"
+ Space-scoped staging ASG set
+ Space-scoped running ASG set

The following table indicates the differences between the four sets.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>When an ASG is bound to the... </th>
    <th>the ASG rules are applied to...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platform-wide staging ASG set</td>
    <td>the staging lifecycle for all apps and tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Platform-wide running ASG set</td>
    <td>the running lifecycle for all app and task instances.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space-scoped staging ASG set</td>
    <td>the staging lifecycle for apps and tasks in a particular space.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space-scoped running ASG set</td>
    <td>the running lifecycle for app and task instances in a particular space.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Typically, ASGs applied during the staging lifecycle are more permissive than the ASGs
applied during the running lifecycle.
This is because staging often requires access to different resources, such as
dependencies.

You use different commands to apply an ASG to each of the four sets. For more information, see the [Procedures](#procedures) section of this topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To apply a staging ASG to apps within a space, you must use the CC API. The cf CLI <code>cf bind-security-group</code> command supports space-scoped running ASGs, but not space-scoped staging ASGs.</p>

### <a id='creating-groups'></a>The Structure and Attributes of ASGs ##

ASG rules are specified as a JSON array of ASG objects. An ASG object has the following attributes:


|Attribute        |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |Notes

##<a id='asg-baseline'></a> About the ASG Creator Tool

The ASG Creator is a command line tool that you can use to create JSON rules
files.
The ASG Creator lets you specify IP addresses, CIDRs, and IP address ranges
that you want to disallow traffic to, as well as the addresses that you want to allow traffic to.
Based on these disallow/allow (exclude/include) lists that you provide as
input, the ASG Creator formulates a JSON file of allow rules.

In turn, the JSON file is the input for the `cf bind-security-group ` command
that creates an ASG.

You can download the latest release of the ASG Creator from the Cloud Foundry incubator repository on Github:  [https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/asg-creator/releases/latest](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/asg-creator/releases/latest)
