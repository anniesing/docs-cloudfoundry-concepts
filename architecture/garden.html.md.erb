This topic describes Garden, the component that Cloud Foundry uses to create and manage isolated environments called containers. Each instance of an application deployed to Cloud Foundry runs within a container. For more information about how containers work, see the [Container Mechanics](../container-security.html#mechanics) section of the <em>Understanding Container Security</em> topic.

##<a id='backends'></a>Backends

Garden has pluggable backends for different platforms and runtimes, and specifies a set of interfaces that each platform-specific backend must implement. These interfaces contain methods to perform the following actions:

- Create and delete containers
- Apply resource limits to containers
- Open and attach network ports to containers
- Copy files into and out of containers
- Run processes within containers
- Stream `STDOUT` and `STDERR` data out of containers
- Annotate containers with arbitrary metadata
- Snapshot containers for redeploys without downtime

For more information, see the [Garden repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden) on GitHub.

##<a id='garden-runc'></a>Garden-runC

Cloud Foundry currently uses the [Garden-runC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-runc-release) backend, a Linux-specific implementation of the Garden interface using the [Open Container Interface](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) (OCI) standard. Previous versions of Cloud Foundry used the [Garden-Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/garden-linux) backend. 

<%= vars.garden_runc %>

Garden-runC has the following features:

* Uses the same OCI low-level container execution code as Docker and Kubernetes, so container images run identically across all three platforms 
* [AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) is configured and enforced
by default for all unprivileged containers
* Seccomp whitelisting restricts the set of system calls a container can access, reducing the risk of container breakout
* Allows pluggable networking and rootfs management
